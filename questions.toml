answers = ["Mickey Mouse"]
alternatives = ["Cloud Strife", "Oswald the Lucky Rabbit", "Donald Duck"]
hint = "Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me?"
explanation = """
    Sora's original was made to mimic the appearance of classic Mickey Mouse, 
    with the red jumpsuit and the huge yellow shoes that would become a staple 
    and also a meme within the KH community.

question = "What is the name of Kairi's nobody"
answers = ["Namine"]
alternatives = ["Kairix", "Marluxia", "Larxene"]
hint = "X is not a letter Kairi is known for."
explanation = """
    Namine was born when Sora released his heart with Ansem's keyblade No Heart 
    in order to return Kairi's heart to her body. This rendered Namine as a Nobody 
    born from Kairi's heart and Sora's body and soul. Kairi's body can't become a 
    Nobody since she has no darkness (as a Princess of Heart).

question = "Which KH-original character has had three different voice actors"
answers = ["Master Xehanort"]
alternatives = ["Luxord", "Xigbar", "Master Ava"]
hint = "This character LOVES the letter X."
explanation = """
    Master Xehanort was originally voiced by legendary actor Leonard Nimoy, 
    the original actor for Spock in Star Trek. Following his death in 2015, 
    Rutger Hauer came in to replace him for KHIII before his own death in 2019, 
    coming to present day with Back to the Future actor Christopher Lloyd taking 
    the role for KHIII Re:Mind.

    The games in release order are as follows: Kingdom Hearts, Chain of Memories, 
    Kingdom Hearts 2, Coded, 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep, Dream Drop Distance, X(chi),

question = "Which two keyblades does Roxas wield when dual-wielding"
answers = ["Oathkeeper", "Oblivion"]
alternatives = ["Kingdom Key", "Destiny's Embrace"]
hint = "Oh, yOu dOn't knOw? The answers are right in frOnt Of yOu!" 
explanation = """
    Both Oathkeeper and Oblivion are symbolic of Sora's memories of Kairi and Riku, 
    respectively. As Sora's nobody, Roxas has access to these powerful keyblades 
    because of Sora's strong bonds with Riku and Kairi. Additionally, it can be 
    argued that these keyblades also fit thematically with Roxas' own bond with Xion, 
    with Oathkeeper symbolizing his promise to stop Xemnas, and Oblivion symbolizing 
    the memory of Xion fading from anyone who knew her.

answers = ["Master Aqua"]
alternatives = ["Kairi", "Alice", "Elsa"]
hint = "Well she's a princess in my heart, but she didn't pass the Mark of Mastery for nothing."
explanation = """
    Aqua is one of the first characters we see pass the Mark of Mastery in BBS, with 
    her test consisting of defeating some balls of light. This is comically easier than 
    the trials Sora and Riku had to go through for their own Mark of Mastery, and yet 
    Terra failed that very same test.

question = "What is the name of the meeting room of Organization 13"

hint = "The true nobodies gather here."
explanation = """
    Also known as the Round Room, the thrones for each member are put at a certain 
    height based on their power or authority within the Organization, with Xemnas 
    (and later Xehanort) holding the highest seat. As the unofficial fourteenth 
    member of the Organization, Xion has no seat, as she was only a failsafe should 
    Roxas turn.

question = "Which of these worlds appear in all three mainline KH games"
answers = ["100 Acre Wood"]
alternatives = ["Atlantica", "Deep Jungle", "Space Paranoids"]
hint = "Oh bother, another set of minigames?"
explanation = """
    The 100 Acre Wood is the only world in the entire series uncorrupted by Heartless, 
    and thus there's no need for the "Attack" command is Sora's command menu.  It is 
    instead replaced with "Hit" to keep it kid-friendly while Pooh goes through a 
    nightmarish existential crisis in the events of KHII. :)
